## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This project uses the Tkinter library and unittest, which is included in the standard Python library, so no additional installation is necessary for it.

## Running the Application

To run the maze solver, navigate to the project directory and run the main Python script. For example:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Features

- Maze generation: Randomly generates mazes that can be solved. In the main file you can change:
  - The size of the maze window
  - Size of the maze
  - Start points to draw the maze cells
  - Number of cell rows and columns
  - The width and height of cells.
- Maze solving: Implements an algorithm to find the path from the start to the end of the maze.
-
- Graphical user interface: Visual representation of the maze and the solving process using Tkinter.

## Testing

To run the tests, navigate to the project directory and run the test Python script. For example:

```bash
python test_maze.py
```
